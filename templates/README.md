# GitRange

Git is confusing. Most of us know the basics, but we all have to Google for
specific incantations from time to time. If you haven't used a different VCS,
like Mercurial, then you may not realize that this Googling for these somewhat
common things isn't normal or necessary--that it's a consequence of Git's
inconsistent UI.

GitRange (`gr`) attempts to bring some of that consistency to git by providing
a common syntax for specifying git commit ranges and passing those ranges to a
git subcommand.
