# GitRange

Git is confusing. Most of us know the basics, but we all have to Google for
specific incantations from time to time. If you haven't used a different VCS,
like Mercurial, then you may not realize that this Googling for these somewhat
common things isn't normal or necessary--that it's a consequence of Git's
inconsistent UI.

GitRange (`gr`) attempts to bring some of that consistency to git by providing
a common syntax for specifying git commit ranges and passing those ranges to a
git subcommand.

All pull requests must pass the [CI checks](./.github/workflows/ci.yml). These
include `mypy --strict` and `black --check` for all Python files. Further, this
README.md is generated by [gen/mkreadme.py](./gen/mkreadme.py). Instead of
editing it directly, edit [gen/README.md](./gen/README.md) (the template file
used to generate it).
